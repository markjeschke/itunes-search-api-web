# iTunes API Search Results Example

Add an iTunes app search field to your webpage, so that visitors can quickly view app information, such as their icons, descriptions, author, pricing, and screenshots.

This version is a self-contained 'dist' version of the [itunes-search-api-gulp-webapp](https://github.com/markjeschke/itunes-search-api-gulp-webapp), but without Gulp, Sass, Bower, and Node dependencies. Simply launch the index.html page and enter an app or keyword search into the field.
